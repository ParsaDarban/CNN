# CNN

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is a deep learning model designed for processing structured grid-like data, such as images. It consists of multiple layers, including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. CNNs are highly effective for tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation due to their hierarchical feature extraction capabilities.

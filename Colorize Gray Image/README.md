In this project, we focused on colorizing grayscale images using an autoencoder architecture. The input to the network is grayscale images, which are converted to Lab color space using the techniques mentioned in the report and then colorized. Additionally, using this model, we colorized grayscale videos both in real-time and offline. 
We also developed a simple UI for handling images.

In this project, we focused on colorizing grayscale images using an autoencoder architecture. The input to the network is grayscale images, which are converted to Lab color space using the techniques mentioned in the report and then colorized. Additionally, using this model, we colorized grayscale videos both in real-time and offline. 
We also developed a simple UI for handling images.  

Due to the large size of the project files, they have been uploaded to Google Drive, and we provide the link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10hI6VgnMvBbbCiXQvheELEd49QqFkZ8T?usp=sharing)

You can find the complete information on data preprocessing, models, and their evaluation in the file CV_ColorizingGrayImages.pdf, which is written in English
